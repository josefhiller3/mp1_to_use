            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Classic rock is a genre that spans from the 1960s to arguably the 1990s. Bands tend to have guitar, bass, and drums players as well as a lead vocalalist. Guitar players tend to use overdrive, distortion, and/or fuzz. Bands also tend to write personal lyrics and try to appeal to younger populations in their appearance. The genre encompasses subgenres such as new wave, which added a synthesizer sounds and college rock, which appealed to the college population.</p>
            <p>Classic rock radios play a variety of artists who have distinct styles and sounds. Some people would be surprised to hear that the Jackson 5 and Led Zeppelin both fall under the same genre. Classic rock had early roots from the 1960s, but once the 1970s hit, the genre greatly expanded.</p>

            <h2>Legends</h2>
            <p>Classic rock has numerous legends. The Beatles and Rolling Stones were two early and influential groups from England that made waves in both the U.K. and U.S. Then, bands like the Who, Pink Floyd, and Led Zeppelin brought the genre to new heights. In the 1980s, bands such as AC/DC and Metallica created heavier hard-hitting rock. Finally, classic rock ends in the 1990s with the advent of grunge bands such as Nirvana and Pearl Jam.</p>
